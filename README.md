1. **How do I approach designing software?
        What new skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
        What design process did you follow for your project work?
        How could tacticts from your design approach be applied in future work?**
        When designing software, a developer needs to focus on the problem statement and design the software so that it has the intended effect in order to not waste             resources. By making the problem statement the centerpoint of every function that the developer creates, the software will be efficient and the end product will         be something that satisfies the client. 

2. **How do I approach developing programs?
        What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
        How did iteration factor into your development?
        How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones?**
        When developing a program, I first look at the problem statement and answer the problem in plain English. I then take that answer and turn it into a machine             statement and expand upon it. With this particular program, the problem statement was a little more involoved since instead of simple data manipultion, I had to         to take the manipulated data and make it behave in a certain manner.
        
3. **How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
        How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
        How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?**         
        I plan on pursuing a career in the Software Development industry so it is safe to say that computer science will be vital to helping me reach my goals.

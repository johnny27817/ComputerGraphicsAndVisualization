1. **How do I approach designing software?
        What new skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
        What design process did you follow for your project work?
        How could tacticts from your design approach be applied in future work?**
        When designing software, a developer needs to focus on the problem statement and design the software so that it has the intended effect in order to not waste             resources. By making the problem statement the centerpoint of every function that the developer creates, the software will be efficient and the end product will         be something that satisfies the client. 

2. **How do I approach developing programs?
        What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
        How did iteration factor into your development?
        How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones?**
